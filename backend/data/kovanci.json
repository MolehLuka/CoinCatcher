The Treaty of Rome established the European Economic Community and ultimately led to the introduction of the euro in 1999 and the euro banknotes and coins in 2002. The anniversary was celebrated on 25 March 2007. The euro area countries have marked the occasion by jointly issuing this commemorative coin. Its design was selected following a competition organised by the European mints. The coin's outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
